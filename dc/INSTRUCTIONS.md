To get started, run the dcrun.sh script. Once it is finished, open the dcresults.csv file.

Because the reports are not consistent, not all data can be retrieved automatically. Please find below information about the data that needs to be extracted manually:

1. Add missing weeks and complete fields with N/A.
2. All the fields that read "could not retrieve" needs to be completed manually.
3. Weekly reports numbers are not final and sometimes are updated in the following week. When visits numbers are zero or inconsistent with the season, a report of a next week should be checked for updates. 
4. For 2012, reports are issued biweekly from Jan-May. Weekly values can be calculated taking the average of the two weeks.
