# Flu-data-scraping
This repo contains python codes that retrieve data from Weekly Influenza Surveillance Report from various states.

Each folder contains a shell scrip that executes the codes and returns a csv file with the data. To get started, download all the content of each folder and run the shell code. 
  
Because the reports are not consistent, not all data can be retrieved automatically. The README file in each folder will explain what is missing from each state.
