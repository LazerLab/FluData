Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity

New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is collaborating with 28* ILI sentinel sites for the 2016-2017 season. Sites report weekly 
on the number of patients that present to their facility with influenza-like illness. That number is then divided by the total number of 
patients seen for any reason, resulting in percent of ILI activity. ILI is defined as fever of > 100° F and cough and sore throat in absence 
of known cause.

Outbreak: An influenza outbreak is defined as at 
least two cases of ILI in a specific area with at least 
one lab confirmed case.

PCR Testing: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests 
can identify the presence of influenza viral RNA in 
respiratory specimens. PCR testing is performed at 
four facilities: NMDOH Scientific Laboratory Division 
(SLD), TriCore Reference Laboratories, New Mexico 
Veterans Affairs (VA) and Gila Regional Medical 
Center (GRMC).
