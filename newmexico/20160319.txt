Influenza Activity in New Mexico for Week Ending March 19, 2016 (MMWR Week 11) 
 
Influenza in the state was at high activity by several indicators1:  
 

1.  Outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI): Twenty-seven sentinel outpatient provider 
sites reported a total of 13,633 patient visits, of which 636 (4.7%) were identified as visits for 
ILI2; which is above the national baseline of 2.1%. Nationally, the percentage of ILI visits was 
3.2%; which is also above baseline (see graph below). 
 
 

 

 
1 Weekly ILI and lab data may change as additional reports are compiled.  
 2 Influenza-like Activity (ILI) is defined as Fever ( 100F [37.8 C], oral or equivalent) AND cough and/or sore throat in the absence of a  
   KNOWN cause other than influenza.

2.  ILI Activity by State Health Regions: by NMDOH regions within the state (refer to the table 
below the graph for regional descriptions).  Weekly ILI ranged from 2.2% (Northeast Region) 
to 6.4% (Metro Region). See graph below for the current season’s weekly ILI by region.

3.  Laboratory tests for influenza:  Since the start of the influenza season, the New Mexico 

Scientific Laboratory Division reported 249 (28.6%) out of 871 respiratory specimens tested 
positive for influenza. 119 (47.8%) specimens were subtype Influenza A (H1N1), 89 (35.7%) 
were subtype Influenza A (H3N2) three specimens were not subtypes (1.2%), and 38 
(15.3%) tested positive for influenza B.

4.  Influenza-related Hospitalizations: The New Mexico Emerging Infections Program (EIP) is 

part of FluSurv-NET (a population-based surveillance system for influenza related 
hospitalizations in children and adults). In New Mexico active, population-based surveillance 
is conducted for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in seven New 
Mexico counties: Bernalillo, Chaves, Dona Ana, Grant, Luna, San Juan, and Santa Fe. Data 
are used to estimate weekly age-specific hospitalization rates for persons hospitalized with 
severe influenza illness. Cumulative incidence rates are calculated using the National 
Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) population estimates for the counties included in the 
surveillance catchment area. Overall, 15.4 people per 100,000 population in New Mexico 
were hospitalized to date for influenza for the 2015-2016 flu season. Nationally, 18.2 per 
100,000 population were hospitalized for influenza. 

 

5.  Influenza and pneumonia-related deaths: There have been 13 influenza-related deaths in 
adults and 102 pneumonia-related deaths among New Mexico residents reported since the 
start of the 2015-2016 influenza season.

6.  Geographic Spread of Influenza in the State: NMDOH reported the state influenza activity 

level as “Widespread” to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). See the 
table on page 5 for the activity level definitions. The map below displays New Mexico activity 
in comparison to influenza activity in bordering states, regions, and nationally for the week 
ending March 19, 2016.

Influenza-like illness:  Fever (> 100oF [37.8oC], oral or equivalent) and cough and/or sore throat (in the absence of a known cause 
other than influenza). 
 
† Lab confirmed case = case confirmed by rapid diagnostic test, antigen detection, culture, or PCR.  Care should be given when relying 
on results of point of care rapid diagnostic test kits during times when influenza is not circulating widely.  The sensitivity and specificity 
of these tests vary and the predicative value positive may be low outside the time of peak influenza activity.  Therefore, at the start of 
the season, NMDOH uses lab confirmation by PCR or culture to declare the presence of lab-confirmed influenza in the state. Positivity 
by other lab methods is recognized and tracked as another influenza activity indicator as the season progresses. 
 
‡ Institution includes nursing home, hospital, prison, school, etc. 
 
**Region: population under surveillance in a defined geographical subdivision of a state.   A region could be comprised of 1 or more 
counties and would be based on each state’s specific circumstances.  In New Mexico, the NMDOH regions are: Northwest Region: 
San Juan, McKinley, and Cibola counties; Northeast Region: Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Taos, Colfax, Union, Mora, Harding, Santa Fe, 
San Miguel and Guadalupe counties; Metro Region: Bernalillo , Sandoval, Torrance and Valencia counties; Southeast Region: 
Quay, Curry, DeBaca, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Chaves, Eddy and Lea counties, and Southwest Region: Socorro, Catron, Grant, Sierra, 
Otero, Dona Ana, Luna and Hidalgo counties.
