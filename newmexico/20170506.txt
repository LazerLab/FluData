Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity

New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is collaborating with 29* ILI sentinel sites for the 2016-2017 season. Sites report weekly 
on the number of patients that present to their facility with influenza-like illness. That number is then divided by the total number of 
patients seen for any reason, resulting in percent of ILI activity. ILI is defined as fever of > 100° F and cough and sore throat in absence 
of known cause.

Outbreak: An influenza outbreak is defined as at 
least two cases of ILI in a specific area with at 
least one lab confirmed case.

PCR Testing: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
tests can identify the presence of influenza viral 
RNA in respiratory specimens. PCR testing is 
performed at various laboratories across New 
Mexico.

Since the start of the 2016-2017 influenza season, laboratories have reported that a total of 2,519 out of 15,091 
respiratory specimens have tested positive for influenza by PCR.  Twenty-seven positive specimens were 
subtyped as A(H1N1), 1,080 were A(H3N2), 1,080 influenza A specimen was not subtyped. Two hundred 
seventy- six tested positive as influenza B not subtyped, 5 positive specimens were identified as B(Victoria) and
