Make sure you are using Python 2 and that PDFMiner (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfminer/) is installed and on path. 

To get started, run the nyrun.sh script. Once it is finished, open the nyresults.csv file.

Because the reports are not consistent, not all data can be retrieved automatically. Please find below information about the data that needs to be extracted manually:

1. The field "Week" need to be entered manually. 
2. The field "Season" needs to be completed manually. Seasons start around week 40 and end around week 20 of the following year.
3. All the fields that read "could not retrieve" needs to be completed manually.
