To get started, run the delawarerun.sh script. Once it is finished, open the delawareresults.csv file.

Because the reports are not consistent, not all data can be retrieved automatically. Please find below information about the data that needs to be extracted manually:

1. The field "Ending Date" need to be cleaned manually. 
2. The field "Season" needs to be completed manually. Seasons start around week 40 and end around week 20 of the following year.
3. Add missing weeks and complete fields with N/A.
4. All the fields that read "could not retrieve" needs to be completed manually.
5. The hospitalization data needs to be retrieved mannualy. The weekly report numbers are not final and are often updated in reports on subsequent weeks. To ensure the most up to date counts, the hospitalization numbers for any given week should be captured in reports of following weeks.
